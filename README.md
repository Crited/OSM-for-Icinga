Some guides for setting up your own OSM tile server on either Ubuntu or Fedora. Additionally, there is a Ubuntu VagrantBox with a running tileserver. The tileserver is setup with mod_tile; renderd; mapnik; osm2pgsql; postgis. Enjoy!


## Updates, Contributing & so on...
I am not certain if i will maintain this repository. Neither am I aware If I am able to maintain this repository. I'll try I guess? If you want to contribute, feel free to fork the project to your GitHub account, give the branch a useful name that tells me whats going on there, aswell as a good commit message --> Pull request and thats it.

But probably, I'll checkout all of the stuff you guys do here, even If you don't organize it nicely. Let me just say: *I would appreciate it.*
